# Lizard

Lizard is a classic card game of trump that can be played by 3-5 players.


## The Deck

To play you need a basic deck of 52 cards, and an additional 4 cards marked as
"lizards" and 4 cards marked as "snakes". In total there are 60 cards in the deck.


## Rules

The game is played in *n* rounds, depending on the number of players
participating (see Appendix).

The game has dealer, this role shifts clockwise after every round. To determine
who starts as the dealer, each player must draw a card at random from the deck.
The player with the highest card will start to deal.


### A round

A round consists of four phases

1. The dealer phase
2. The estimation phase
3. The play phase
4. The end phase


#### The dealer phase

At the beginning of the first round each player is dealt **one** card. The
second round each player is dealt two cards and so on.

After every player as been dealt their cards, the top of card of the deck is
turned face up, the color of the cards determines the "trump" color for that
round. For example: if a nine of hearts is turned up, hearts are the trump color
for that round.


#### Estimation phase

Before the play starts each player shall estimate how many tricks they will win.
The number of tricks in a round equals to the number of cards each player has
been dealt. For example: in the third round there are three tricks to be won.


#### Play phase

The first person to play card is the one clockwise from the dealer.

The goal is to win as many tricks as you've guessed during the estimation phase.

To win a trick you have to play the highest card in suit, or play a Lizard card,
or if you play the highest trump card.


#### Rules of play

- The first card played determines the suit that has to be followed.  You must
- follow color and suit if you can A Lizard card will always win a trick (unless
- a lizard has already been played by another player in the same trick) A snake
- will always lose a trick (unless a snake has already been played by another
- player in the same trick)


#### How to win a trick

- Be the first player in a trick to play a Lizard Play the highest card in suit
- Play the highest trump card (in case a player cannot follow suit)


#### The End phase

At the end of the round, each player counts the number of tricks won.

- If a player won the same number of tricks as estimated, they get 20 points,
- plus 10 points for each trick won. For example: A player estimated and won 5
- tricks, they get 70 points (20 + 50).
- If a player didn't match their estimation, they get minus 10 points for the
- difference between their estimation and number of tricks won. For example: A
- player estimated 5 tricks, but only won 3, they get -20 points (5 - 3 = 2 x
- 10)

The score for each player during a round is subtracted/added to their existing
score from previous rounds. Each player starts the first round with a score of
0.


### End game, The last round

The last round happens when all the cards in the deck have been dealt. For
example: if there are 4 players the game will last for 15 rounds, in the last
round each player will be dealt 15 cards, which means all 60 cards in the deck
have been dealt.


## Winning condition

The player with the highest score after all rounds have been played is the
winner and the new Lizard King!
